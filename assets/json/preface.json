		"preface":"Every generation all along the line of the history of the church have a pattern of music which they use in worship. The kind of music that any people produce is a reflection of their heart condition and their relationship with the Father. The songs carry the theology of the people and reflect their understanding of God. Songs written in the time of revival portray the people's experience of GOD.\n\nOur nation is passing through a period of terrible experience. Yet the cry in our heart is that God should send us a revival. But we know certainly that any revival sent to us at a time when right men who know the right methods of ministry are not on the ground would be wasted. Thus, before the revival comes, we need correct men who bears the correct message and who knows the correct methods of ministry. Such men who the master has sat upon and has poured His life into them. These are the disciples of Jesus\n\nSuch men who lived and laboured in the yesteryears wrote hymn that still communicate the mind of Christ. Here is a compilation of some of such hymns and a few written by men of like mind who are looking up to God for a visitation.\n\nA careful look at the music played in the Church now shows that the Church is in the wilderness. As we pray carefully through these hymns, we are asking that God may visit His saving grace upon our lives and grant us a revival that our land may enter into rest.\n\n",
