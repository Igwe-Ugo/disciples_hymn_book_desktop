A faith that shines more bright and clear\nWhen tempests rage without\nThat when in danger knows no fear\nIn darkness feels no doubt,-\n\n4. A faith that keeps the narrow way\nTill life's last spark is fled\nAnd with a pure and heavenly ray\nLights up the dying bed.\n\n5. Lord, give me such a faith as this,\nAnd then, whate'er may come,\nI taste e'en now the hallowed bliss\nOf an Eternal Home.",
